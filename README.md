# Notes Playground

This is an experimental project where I play around with **Nx** and monorepos.  
The core idea is a simple notes app, but implemented through multiple different front-end applications to explore various approaches and setups.

## Features

- Multiple front-end apps, each implementing a basic notes app  
- Shared workspace managed with **Nx**  
- A place to explore monorepo architecture and tooling
